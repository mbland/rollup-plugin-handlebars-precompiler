      # dorny/test-reporter has an `artifact:` attribute that will check out the
      # repo and download test results automatically. However,
      # dorny/test-reporter@v1 wasn't compatible with the bump to
      # actions/upload-artifact@v4 in run-tests.yaml. So we manually check
      # out the repo and download the results to avoid the rev lock.
